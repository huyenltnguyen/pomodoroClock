**Objective:** Build a [CodePen.io](https://codepen.io/#) app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/aNyxXR/.
#### User stories:
  1. I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
  2. I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
  3. I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
